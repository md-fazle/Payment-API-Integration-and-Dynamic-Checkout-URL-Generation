# Payment-API-Integration-and-Dynamic-Checkout-URL-Generation
   The work you've done can be summarized as creating a RESTful API Integration with ASP.NET Core MVC for generating dynamic payment checkout URLs. Here's a structured conclusion about this work:  Project Title: Payment API Integration and Dynamic Checkout URL Generation Key Features: Dynamic Model Generation:  Created a model (PaymentModel) with dynamically generated values for fields like amount, startDate, expiryDate, and others, ensuring unique and randomized values for each API request. REST API Integration:  Built an API controller (PaymentController) that interacts with an external payment API (bKash API) using HttpClient for making HTTP POST requests. Configured API headers with an API key for secure communication. Error Handling:  Implemented error handling to return appropriate HTTP status codes and error messages if the external API call fails. Dependency Injection:  Utilized ASP.NET Core's built-in dependency injection to manage the HttpClient lifecycle, ensuring efficient and secure HTTP requests. Routing Setup:  Configured routing in Program.cs to support both MVC and API-style requests seamlessly. JSON Serialization:  Used Newtonsoft.Json for serializing models into JSON format to send to the external payment API.
